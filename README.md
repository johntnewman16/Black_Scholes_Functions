# Black_Scholes_Functions

In this code, I aim to implement a couple of different actions related to Options Pricing and the Black-Scholes Equation. As of 05/04/2018 I have calculated option values, self-replicating portfolios, evolution of Greeks and a delta hedge. When the opportunity arises, I hope to add additional types of hedges (vega and gamma specifically), and then implement all of the functions in JupyterNotebook with widgets, in order to use sliders to see how each of the derivatives vary with respect to input values.
